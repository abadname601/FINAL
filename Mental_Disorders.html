            <p>Welcome to our comprehensive guide to understanding mental disorders. At some point in our lives, many of us will face challenges related to mental health. Whether it's experiencing anxiety before a big presentation, feeling down for an extended period, or coping with the loss of a loved one, mental health concerns are common and normal. However, when these challenges become persistent and start affecting daily life, they may indicate the presence of a mental disorder.</p>

            <p class="large-text">What are Mental Disorders?</p>
            <p>Mental disorders, also known as psychiatric disorders, cover a broad spectrum of conditions impacting mood, cognition, and behavior. Ranging from depression and anxiety to schizophrenia and substance use disorders, these conditions can disrupt daily life and relationships. While their origins may involve genetics, environment, or a combination of factors, effective treatment often involves a blend of therapy, medication, and support services tailored to each individual. However, stigma remains a significant barrier to care, highlighting the ongoing need for awareness, empathy, and accessible resources to support those affected by mental illness.</p>

                    <strong>Bipolar Disorder: </strong>Bipolar disorder affects about 2.8% of adults in the United States annually, as reported by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). It is a mood disorder characterized by extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). During manic episodes, individuals may experience elevated mood, increased energy, racing thoughts, decreased need for sleep, and risky behavior. Depressive episodes involve symptoms similar to major depression. Bipolar disorder can significantly impact daily functioning and relationships if left untreated.

                    <strong>Schizophrenia: </strong>Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder that affects approximately 20 million people worldwide, according to the WHO. It is characterized by a range of symptoms, including hallucinations (perceiving things that aren't real), delusions (false beliefs), disorganized thinking and speech, reduced expression of emotions, and impaired social functioning. Individuals with schizophrenia may also experience cognitive deficits, such as difficulties with attention, memory, and executive functioning. Treatment typically involves a combination of antipsychotic medications, therapy, and support services to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.

                    <strong>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder(OCD): </strong>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) affects around 1.2% of adults in the United States. It involves intrusive, distressing thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions) that individuals feel driven to perform. Common obsessions include fears of contamination or harming oneself or others. Compulsions often manifest as repetitive actions like handwashing or checking. OCD can significantly impact daily functioning and cause distress. Treatment typically includes cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and medication. With proper support, individuals with OCD can manage their symptoms and lead fulfilling lives.

                    <strong>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): </strong>PTSD can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, such as combat, natural disaster, physical assault, or sexual violence. It affects about 7-8% of the population at some point in their lives, as estimated by the National Center for PTSD. Symptoms may include flashbacks (reliving the traumatic event), nightmares, severe anxiety, hypervigilance (being constantly on guard), avoidance of reminders of the trauma, and negative changes in mood and cognition. PTSD can significantly impair functioning and quality of life without proper treatment, which may include therapy, medication, and support groups.

                    <strong>Attention-Deficit/Hypereactivity Disorder (ADHD): </strong>ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood, affecting approximately 9.4% of children aged 2-17 years in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which can interfere with functioning and development. Symptoms of inattention may include difficulty sustaining attention, being easily distracted, forgetfulness, and disorganization. Hyperactivity symptoms may manifest as fidgeting, restlessness, and difficulty staying seated. Impulsivity can lead to interrupting others, acting without considering consequences, and difficulty waiting turns. ADHD can persist into adulthood and may require a combination of behavioral therapy, medication, and support strategies for management.

                    <strong>Eating Disorders: </strong>Eating disorders are complex mental health conditions that significantly impact an individual's physical and psychological well-being. Beyond commonly known disorders like anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder, there are other variations such as orthorexia nervosa and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). These disorders involve disruptions in eating behaviors, body image, and weight regulation, affecting individuals of all ages and genders, though young women are particularly vulnerable.

                    <strong>Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD): </strong>Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a complex mental disorder characterized by pervasive instability in mood, self-image, behavior, and interpersonal relationships. People with BPD often experience intense emotional distress and have difficulty regulating their emotions and impulses. Key features include a fear of abandonment, impulsivity, unstable relationships, and identity disturbance. Treatment typically involves psychotherapy, medication, and support from loved ones, aiming to help individuals manage symptoms and improve their quality of life.

                    <strong>Postpartum Depression (PPD): </strong>Postpartum depression (PPD) is a type of mood disorder that affects women after childbirth. It is estimated to occur in about 10-15% of mothers, though rates may vary depending on cultural and socioeconomic factors. PPD can manifest as feelings of sadness, anxiety, irritability, and exhaustion that persist beyond the typical "baby blues" period. It can also interfere with a mother's ability to care for herself and her newborn. Factors such as hormonal changes, sleep deprivation, and the stress of adjusting to motherhood can contribute to the development of PPD. Treatment may involve therapy, support groups, medication, and practical support from healthcare providers and loved ones to help mothers navigate this challenging period and bond with their baby. Early detection and intervention are crucial for the well-being of both the mother and the child.
